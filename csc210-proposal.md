Every American who wants to vote but has no idea who to vote.

Background: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Turnout rates for eligible voters has been decreasing since 1970’s and it is only around 50%(stats at 2008) right now. This means that about half of the population who has the right to vote do not vote. There is no other developed democracy in the world that, when it holds an election in which all of the seats in the lower house of the national legislature are on the ballot, has a turnout of less than half of its eligible voters. In the United States, it happens every midterm election and will happen again next month.

2.There are many issues that lead to the voters apathy, and there is an apparent factors among this causes which is that most of time the eligible voters have no idea who to vote. The number of candidates is rising, while the voters are more likely to be bored about the political process and know little about the candidates. 

3.The youngsters occupy a great proportion among those who do not vote. “Young people don't vote not because they are turned off by the mean bad politicians but because they don't know who those politicians are, what do they stand for, what are the issues of the day, and how best to resolve those issues”,  says The Economist. 

4.Therefore we intend to create a system to simplify the process of getting the knowledge about the candidates. With ….. (name) the voters do not have to manually look for relevant information about a candidate, but just simply select the view of points they support and the system will automatically return the best matched candidate with his/her relevant information.

How will it meet the project requirement?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Create:Users can create a personal account on the system. User can select or manually fill in their political inclination. Based on some basic personal info from the users, the system will automatically pick up a few candidates that might interest the user even before the users enter their political affiliation. The information will be stored to the database

2.Read: When the user login the next time, the most recent selection they made will be loaded to their homepage. The application will also implement some APIs of the mainstream news website, newspaper, magazines and also social media like Twitter and Facebook so that once the user is logged in again, he/she is able to view the most updated news feed about the candidate he/she cares about.

3.Update: The user can always change their affiliation to reflect their change of opinions. 

4.Delete: The user can delete their inclinations.

Why is it unique?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.It is trying to provide a solution to a realistic problem which is universally existing.

2.It will own some interesting interactive elements and user-friendly interface, including the ability of allowing user to draw and drag on the “inclination map”!

3.Beyond fancy front end design, it will also stand out due to the smart and intelligent algorithm it runs in the back end to generate and categorize the candidates. We will implement data mining method to “mine” through the massive information on the Internet. 

4.The code running on the back end will also ensure that all the information is accurate and up to date.
